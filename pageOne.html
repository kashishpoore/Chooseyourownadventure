    <center> <h1>Welcome to the first step in a long journey. This is your story. </h1>
    <p> In the midst of a war, against a wall of shadows called the Fold, and against enemies on both sides, you are a cartographer in the army. The fold has taken both your parents from you and your best friend Mal is a tracker. He has been called to go into the Fold with his unit. You can either go with him, or stay behind. What do you choose?</p>

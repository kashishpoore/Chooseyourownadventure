      <center> <h1> Everybody makes choices. Not everyone makes very good ones though. </h1>
      <p> Mal left two days ago. You chose to stay behind. A bit cowardly but your bond will last. Assuming he doesn't die in there though. The king comes to your camp to see power potential. In this world what determines your worth are powers. They test you and find potential. But having powers means going to a palace faraway from Mal. What do you choose?</p>

      <center> <h1>Good luck. Pack light. It's gonna be a tough ride. And never turn on any lights inside the Fold. </h1>
      <p> As you get onto the ship, Mal comes over. He tells you to stay down no matter what. The first five minutes, everything is fine. But then the lights go out and somebody lights a lantern. This attracts the Volcra and they start eating all your friends. You can either run and save yourself or you can stay and fight. What do you choose?</p>

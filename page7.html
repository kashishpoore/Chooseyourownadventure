      <center> <h1> Enjoy the castle </h1>
      <p> At the castle you meet many people. Some are not very nice and some are. But they all have powers. As you learn to use your powers, you grow a lot stronger. Unfortunately that attracts two things. Danger and Power. If you choose to go forth you could become the most powerful being in all of Ravkal. If you back out. You will lead a normal life. What do you choose?</p>
